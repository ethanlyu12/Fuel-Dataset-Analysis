# Fuel-Dataset-Analysis
# Project Description - Fall 2024

This document provides details about the datasets used for the group project. The datasets contain real-world fuel purchase and sales data from city gas stations. Some elements have been obfuscated to protect proprietary information.

## Data Dictionary

### `Locations.csv`
Contains gas station location details:
- **Gas Station Location**: Unique ID of the gas station
- **Gas Station Name**: Name of the gas station
- **Gas Station Address**: Address of the gas station
- **Gas Station Latitude/Longitude**: Geographical coordinates

### `Tanks.csv`
Information about gas station tanks:
- **Tank ID**: Unique identifier of each tank
- **Tank Location**: Gas station where the tank is located
- **Tank Number**: Identifier for each tank at a location
- **Tank Type**: Fuel type: `U` (Regular), `D` (Diesel), `P` (Premium)
- **Tank Capacity**: Tank capacity in liters

### `Invoices.csv`
Records fuel purchases by gas stations:
- **Invoice Date**: Date of purchase
- **Invoice ID**: Unique identifier for invoices
- **Invoice Gas Station Location**: Location of the gas station
- **Gross Purchase Cost**: Total cost in CAD
- **Amount Purchased**: Volume of fuel purchased in liters
- **Fuel Type**: Type of fuel purchased

### `Fuel_Level_Part_1.csv` and `Fuel_Level_Part_2.csv`
Fuel level tracking data:
- **Tank ID**: Identifier of the tank
- **Fuel Level**: Fuel volume remaining in liters
- **Time Stamp**: Timestamp of the fuel level reading

## Problem Description
A gas station purchases fuel in bulk (thousands of liters) to meet the needs of its customers. Each gas station may offer different fuel types (regular gas, premium gas, diesel), with each type stored in one or more underground tanks. The number and capacity of these tanks are influenced by factors such as available space, city regulations, proximity to suppliers, and demand.
At any given time, a gas station might carry tens of thousands of liters of fuel. Decisions regarding fuel replenishment frequency and fuel replenishment quantity are crucial for profitability and operational efficiency. Frequent replenishments in small quantities reduce cash tied up in inventory but may miss out on quantity discounts offered by suppliers. Conversely, larger, less frequent deliveries often qualify for discounts but require higher upfront costs (see Figure 1). Note that quantity discounts are applied separately for each gas station location and fuel type; purchases cannot be aggregated across locations or fuel types.

Gas stations purchase fuel in bulk to meet customer demands. Inventory management affects operational efficiency and profitability. Stations must balance:
- Frequent small deliveries (lower upfront cost, no bulk discounts)
- Large, less frequent deliveries (higher initial cost, bulk purchase discounts)

### Quantity Discounts
The supplier offers the following quantity discounts:
| Purchase Quantity (liters) | Discount per Liter (CAD) |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| 0 - 15,000                | 0                        |
| 15,000 - 25,000           | 0.02                     |
| 25,000 - 40,000           | 0.03                     |
| 40,000+                   | 0.04                     |

## Business Questions

The project aims to optimize fuel inventory management by addressing:

### 1. Evaluating Current Inventory Management Practices
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Merge `Tanks.csv`, `Locations.csv`, and `Invoices.csv`
  - Concatenate `Fuel_Level_Part_1.csv` and `Fuel_Level_Part_2.csv`
  - Handle missing values and clean data
- **Visualization**: Assess fuel levels over time for each tank
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluate purchase patterns and cost savings for stations 1â€“8

### 2. Recommending Improved Ordering Strategies
- **Maximize Discount Savings**:
  - Analyze tank capacity to determine highest applicable discount rate
  - Calculate 7-day inventory threshold for each station
  - Optimize order quantities to balance cost and inventory needs
- **Recommendations**:
  - Propose ordering strategies per location with estimated cost savings

### 3. Identifying the Best Day for Fuel Orders
- **Analyze price trends by day of the week**
- **Identify the cheapest day to purchase fuel**
- **Estimate additional savings from strategic order timing**

### 4. Evaluating Feasibility of Adding Tanks
- **Assess potential benefits of increasing tank capacity**
- **Estimate cost-benefit over a 5-year period considering inflation**
- **Identify stations where additional tanks would be most beneficial**
